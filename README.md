# DevDoctor

DevDoctor is a project-aware CLI tool that helps developers diagnose environment and setup issues before they become problems.

It detects the project type (Java, Node.js, Docker, etc.) and runs smart checks to answer a simple question:

> "Is my machine ready to run this project?"

## Vision
- Reduce onboarding friction
- Catch environment issues early
- Provide clear, actionable suggestions
- Stay lightweight and developer-friendly

## Status
🚧 Work in progress (early development)

## Planned Features
- Project detection (Maven, Gradle, Node, Docker Compose)
- Environment checks (Java, Node, Docker, Git)
- Project-aware diagnostics (ports, versions, dependencies)
- Actionable suggestions
- JSON output for automation
